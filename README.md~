# Flask on Heroku

This is the milestone Heroku app project for TDI, I found the links below really helpful to start with for people with completely zero experience with web/app development before.

The first repo is a step by step introductioni about how to start from zero to create your first flask app. Definitely worth reading and trying it.

The the second repository is a copy from TDI instruction, provides a basic template for a Flask configuration that will
work on Heroku. There are also quite some useful links about flask and heroku inside.

The last link is the quick start to get along with heroku.

- A useful reference is the Heroku [quickstart guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python).
